# Stakeholder Sunburst Visualization - Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the Stakeholder Sunburst visualization, addressing text placement issues and enhancing the insights capabilities using CPC/unified data.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Better Text Placement** ✅

**Problem:** Text labels were difficult to read, especially on smaller segments.

**Solution:** Implemented radial rotation (`rotate: 'radial'`) similar to the ECharts example provided:
- Labels now follow the curve of the segments naturally
- Added `minAngle` thresholds to prevent label clutter
- Implemented text truncation for long names on outer ring
- Improved font sizing per level (12px → 11px → 9px)

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
label: {
  rotate: 'radial', // Better text placement - follows the curve
  minAngle: 5, // Only show labels for segments wider than 5 degrees
},
```

### 2. **Enhanced Insights Panel** ✅

**Individual Stakeholder Insights:**
- Full stakeholder details (Type, Mode, RACI, Strategic Theme, Focus Area)
- **NEW:** Connected entities from unified data showing relationships
- RACI badges for better visual distinction
- Scrollable panel for long lists

**Parent Segment Statistics:**
- **NEW:** Total count prominently displayed
- **NEW:** Distribution breakdowns (Mode/Type distribution with percentages)
- **NEW:** Progress bars for visual representation
- **NEW:** RACI distribution showing role counts
- **NEW:** Top Focus Areas (top 5)

### 3. **Unified Data Integration** ✅

**Available Data Sources:**
- ✅ CPC stakeholder data (type, mode, theme, RACI, focus areas)
- ✅ Unified entities from `@/data/unified`
- ✅ Unified relationships from `@/data/unified`

**Features:**
- Automatically finds stakeholder in unified data by name/ID matching
- Shows connected entities (stakeholders, projects, technologies)
- Displays relationship types
- Limited to 10 most relevant connections for performance

**Data Sufficiency Analysis:**

**✅ Sufficient for Insights:**
- ✅ Stakeholder hierarchy (Type → Mode → Stakeholders)
- ✅ Distribution statistics (counts, percentages)
- ✅ RACI role distribution
- ✅ Focus area mapping
- ✅ Strategic theme grouping

**⚠️ Limited (but available):**
- Relationships in unified data may not fully map CPC stakeholder IDs
- Projects/Technologies connections depend on unified data completeness
- Funding data not directly available in CPC stakeholder structure

**💡 Recommendations for Enhanced Insights:**

1. **Map CPC Stakeholder IDs to Unified Data:**
   - Create a mapping file linking `sh-001` → unified entity IDs
   - This would enable richer relationship insights

2. **Add Funding Data:**
   - If available, aggregate funding amounts per stakeholder type/mode
   - Show funding distribution in insights panel

3. **Add Project Associations:**
   - If CPC stakeholders participate in projects, link them
   - Show active/completed projects in insights

### 4. **Visual Enhancements** ✅

**Improved Tooltips:**
- Better formatting with structured layout
- Shows all relevant information (Type, Mode, RACI, Theme, Focus Area)
- Counts with proper pluralization

**Enhanced Emphasis:**
- Shadow effects on hover
- Focus on ancestor segments
- Better color contrast

**Better Level Styling:**
- Border colors and widths optimized per level
- Consistent spacing (10% → 35% → 65% → 90%)
- White borders for better segment separation

## Usage Examples

### Clicking Individual Stakeholder:
- Shows full stakeholder details
- Displays connected entities from unified data (if found)
- Shows relationship types

### Clicking Parent Segment (Type/Mode/Theme):
- Shows total stakeholder count
- Distribution breakdown with percentages and progress bars
- RACI role distribution
- Top focus areas

## Data Availability Assessment

### Currently Available:

1. **CPC Stakeholder Data:**
   - 27 stakeholders with complete metadata
   - Type taxonomy (11 types)
   - Transport modes (5 modes)
   - Strategic themes (6 themes)
   - RACI roles (4 roles)
   - Focus areas

2. **Unified Data:**
   - BaseEntity[] with stakeholder entities
   - UniversalRelationship[] with connections
   - Helper functions: `getEntity()`, `getRelationshipsForEntity()`

### For Rich Insights Generation:

**✅ What Works Now:**
- Type/Mode/Theme statistics
- Distribution breakdowns
- RACI analysis
- Focus area mapping

**🔧 What Could Be Enhanced:**
- Direct stakeholder ID mapping to unified data
- Funding aggregation per segment
- Project/Technology associations
- Timeline/historical data

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components:

1. **Segment Insights Generator:**
   - Analyzes selected node type (stakeholder vs parent)
   - Collects all stakeholders under parent segments
   - Calculates distributions and statistics
   - Fetches relationships from unified data

2. **Text Placement Optimizer:**
   - Uses ECharts `radial` rotation
   - Implements angle thresholds
   - Handles text truncation

3. **Statistics Calculator:**
   - Mode/Type distributions
   - RACI role counts
   - Focus area aggregations
   - Percentage calculations

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Quick Wins):
1. ✅ **Done:** Better text placement
2. ✅ **Done:** Statistics for parent segments
3. ✅ **Done:** Connected entities display
4. 🔧 Create ID mapping file for CPC → Unified data

### Medium-term:
1. Add funding data aggregation
2. Enhance project/technology connections
3. Add export functionality (CSV/PNG)
4. Implement search/filter in insights panel

### Long-term:
1. Add timeline/historical view
2. Implement drill-down animations
3. Add comparison mode (compare two segments)
4. Create insights export (PDF report)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Text labels are readable on all segments
- [x] Clicking individual stakeholder shows details
- [x] Clicking parent segment shows statistics
- [x] Connected entities appear when available
- [x] Distribution charts render correctly
- [x] Panel is scrollable for long content
- [x] All three view types work (By Type, By Mode, By Theme)

## Conclusion

The Stakeholder Sunburst visualization now provides:
- ✅ **Better UX:** Improved text placement and readability
- ✅ **Rich Insights:** Comprehensive statistics for any clicked segment
- ✅ **Data Integration:** Connected entities from unified data
- ✅ **Visual Polish:** Enhanced tooltips, emphasis, and styling

**Data Sufficiency:** The current CPC/unified data is **sufficient** for generating meaningful insights, with opportunities for enhancement through better ID mapping and additional data sources.
