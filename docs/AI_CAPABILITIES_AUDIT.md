## Technical Debt / Improvements Needed

1. **Function Call Implementation**: Functions are defined but may not be fully wired up in all visualizations
2. **Error Handling**: Better error messages when functions fail
3. **Context Size Management**: May need to optimize context injection for very large datasets
4. **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on AI requests (could be expensive)
5. **Caching**: No caching of AI responses (could improve performance)
6. **Testing**: Limited testing of AI function calls across all visualizations

## Summary

**Current State**: The AI has solid foundational capabilities:
- ✅ Conversational chat with context awareness
- ✅ Knowledge base access (keyword + semantic)
- ✅ Basic UI control (switch views, adjust controls, filter, highlight)
- ✅ Insights integration
- ✅ Admin configurability

**Gaps**: Missing advanced capabilities that would make it more powerful:
- ⚠️ Voice interface (planned but not implemented)
- ⚠️ Advanced analysis (statistical, comparative, predictive)
- ⚠️ Scenario modeling via natural language
- ⚠️ Proactive insights and recommendations
- ⚠️ Complex multi-step operations
- ⚠️ Temporal and relationship analysis

**Recommendation**: Focus on **Scenario Modeling** and **Proactive Insights** next, as these provide high value with moderate implementation effort.
