# Waterfall Chart - Clarification Needed

## What the User Wants:
Shows **"Where does the money go?"** - a breakdown of total funding by programme.

**Current Scenario View:**
- Total Funding: £17.4B
- Breakdown:
  - UKRI: £X
  - ATI Programme: £Y
  - Advanced Fuels Fund: £Z
  - Other: £W

**Scenario Adjustments:**
- Adjust sliders → recalculate allocations → show NEW breakdown

## Question:
Should this be:
1. **Waterfall chart** (Total → subtracts each programme → remaining)
2. **Bar chart** (Total bar, then separate bars for each programme)
3. **Stacked bar** (Total bar with segments showing each programme)

I've built option 1, but it might not be the clearest visualization. Let me know your preference!
