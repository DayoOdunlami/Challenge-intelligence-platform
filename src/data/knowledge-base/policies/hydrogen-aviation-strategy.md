**Source:** [Launching Hydrogen-Powered Aviation Report](https://hydrogeninaviation.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Launching-Hydrogen-Powered-Aviation-Report.pdf)  
**Date:** March 2024  
**Organization:** Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA)  
**Last Updated:** 2024-03

## Overview

Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA) was established in summer 2023, bringing together leading organisations across the aviation value chain: airlines, airports, manufacturers, infrastructure, and energy production. The coalition includes Airbus, Bristol Airport, easyJet, GKN Aerospace, Ørsted, Rolls-Royce, and ZeroAvia.

## Core Mission

> "Our core mission is to ensure the UK maximises its opportunity to be a global leader in hydrogen-powered aviation."

**Key Quote:**
> "Hydrogen presents a significant opportunity to help realise Net Zero flight, as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or as a direct fuel; we will need both uses to achieve this."

## Key Milestones & Timeline

### Short-term (2024-2026)
- Additional CAA funding and capacity to enable hydrogen-ready regulations and standards

- Two medium-scale liquid hydrogen Test Hubs
- Mature UK test capability network
- Hydrogen pioneer airports network established
- Skills development programmes at pioneer airports

### Long-term (2031-2050)
- Commercial hydrogen-powered flights operational
- Hydrogen infrastructure at major UK airports
- UK as global leader in hydrogen-powered aviation technology

## Policy Recommendations

### Chapter 1: Building the Aircraft

1. **Government Support for HCN**
   - Continue to support and utilise the work of the Hydrogen Capability Network (HCN) in policy development
   - Engage industry on future public investment

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Support development of two medium-scale liquid hydrogen Test Hubs
   - Mature the UK's test capability network

3. **R&D Funding**
   - Amend UK R&D funding rules to allow public investment in aerospace technologies beyond TRL6
   - Reinvest funds from UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) back into aerospace technology development

4. **Regulatory Framework**
   - From 2025, CAA should be appropriately resourced to develop required standards, procedures, and regulations
   - CAA should represent UK in working with EASA and FAA on regulatory alignment

5. **Skills Development**
   - Establish National Hydrogen Academy by 2025
   - Ensure continued access to talent from abroad

### Chapter 2: Making Hydrogen for Aviation

1. **Funding Flexibility**
   - Bring greater flexibility into allocation rounds for hydrogen production funding

2. **Policy Clarity**
   - Provide clarity and stability on timings, policy, and targets towards 2035
   - Clarify plans for hydrogen production beyond 2035, up to 2050

3. **Demand Planning**
   - Aviation sector demand requirements should form part of national calculations for future hydrogen demand
   - Trade bodies to form '2035-2050' taskforce to assess potential hydrogen production levels

4. **Renewable Energy**
   - Maintain momentum towards increasing deployment of renewables
   - Establish fairer cost allocation that reduces electricity network costs for low-carbon hydrogen producers

### Chapter 3: Getting Hydrogen to the Airport

1. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Government and industry should fund project to understand 'tipping point' for hydrogen supply to individual airports
   - Aviation industry should engage with government, local hydrogen clusters, National Gas, and regional gas distribution networks

2. **Airport Masterplans**
   - In 2024, Government should update guidance on airport masterplans to consider future hydrogen infrastructure needs
   - Every airport should have a broader 'hydrogen-ready' plan

### Chapter 4: Getting the Plane in the Air

1. **Pioneer Airports**
   - Create network of hydrogen pioneer airports as testing ground
   - Industry should collaborate internationally on network of hydrogen-ready airports

2. **Financial Support**
   - Government should establish hydrogen transition fund for aviation to support airlines and airport operators with initial costs
   - Develop policy support to improve price competitiveness of hydrogen-powered aircraft vs kerosene-powered

3. **Workforce Development**
   - Industry to develop future workforce plans
   - Work with academia to build curriculums addressing future skills needs
   - Support work of Hydrogen Skills Alliance (HSA) in developing specific skills strategy

## Industry Pledges

### Airbus
> "Airbus has the ambition to deliver our first ZEROe aircraft by 2035, powered by hydrogen, and aims to certify all of our civil aircraft to be able to run on 100% SAF by 2030."

### Bristol Airport
> "Bristol Airport pledges to be a leading player in facilitating zero-carbon flight... We will actively support the development of Airport hydrogen infrastructure with the aim of enabling commercial flights by 2035."

### easyJet
> "easyJet pledges to support the advancement of hydrogen powered flight in partnership with our UK airports and wider stakeholders. This fits with our Net Zero Roadmap to reach net zero by 2050 in which hydrogen plays a key role."

### GKN Aerospace
> "GKN Aerospace pledges to continue investing the majority of its research and development expenditure in technologies and products that will help to decarbonise the sector."

### Ørsted
> "We as Ørsted are committed to our vision to create a world that runs entirely on green energy, with green hydrogen playing a key role to de-fossilise hard-to-electrify industries."

### Rolls-Royce
> "Rolls-Royce is committed to achieving Net Zero across its value chain... We believe that the route to net zero aviation will be delivered through developing more efficient gas turbine engines, the transition to sustainable fuels and new technologies including through aircraft design, all working together."

### ZeroAvia
> "ZeroAvia pledges to continue in its efforts to deliver the clean future of flight for the entirety of aviation by developing hydrogen-electric propulsion and fuel infrastructure. We pledge to enable regional aircraft flying with zero-emissions this decade to catalyse adoption, and to scale our technologies to support true zero flight in narrowbody aircraft in the 2030s."

## Key Statistics

- **UK Aviation Emissions:** ~7% of UK's total emissions
- **UK Aerospace GDP Contribution:** £22bn directly, plus £34bn from exporting aerospace components
- **UK Aerospace Employment:** Over 230,000 people across four nations
- **Hydrogen Energy Density:** Three times higher than kerosene per unit mass (but lower volumetric density)

## Government Coordination

The report identifies four government departments holding different parts of the puzzle:
1. Department for Business and Trade (DBT)
2. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ)
3. Department for Transport (DfT)
4. His Majesty's Treasury (HMT)

Plus two key regulators:
- Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
- Health and Safety Executive (HSE)

## Recommendations for Government Structure

1. **Lead Department:** A lead government department should be appointed with responsibility for delivering the strategy
2. **Clear Plan:** Industrial strategy for aviation needs agreed objectives and plan by end of 2025
3. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Different parts of sector should work together to support common goal
