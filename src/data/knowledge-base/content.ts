   - Committed to developing commercial scale hydrogen-powered aircraft
   - Target: Entering service in 2035
   - ZEROe aircraft programme

2. **ZeroAvia**
   - UK-based hydrogen-electric aircraft developer
   - Aircraft already flying today
   - Focus on regional and narrowbody aircraft

## Technical Characteristics

### Energy Density

> "While its energy-per-unit mass is three times higher than traditional kerosene-based jet fuel, its volumetric density is much lower."

**Key Quote from Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus:**
> "This leads to significant design challenges, but those whose solution is at reach with current technological capabilities."

### Propulsion Options

Hydrogen enables multiple options for aircraft propulsion:

1. **Direct Combustion**
   - Hydrogen burned in modified gas turbine engines
   - Similar to current jet engines but using hydrogen fuel

2. **Fuel-Cell Electricity**
   - Hydrogen converted to electricity via fuel cells
   - Powers electric motors for propulsion

3. **Combination (Hybrid)**
   - Combination of both direct combustion and fuel-cell electricity
   - Optimizes efficiency and power output

4. **Synthetic Fuels Feedstock**
   - Hydrogen as feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production
   - Enables low-carbon synthetic kerosene

## Development Timeline

### By End of This Decade (2030)
- Airbus will have launched its commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft programme
