- **Total Economic Contribution:** £56bn+
- **Direct Employment:** Over 230,000 people across four nations of the UK

### Industry Description
> "Our sector is one of the greatest success stories of the UK economy... UK Aerospace is a crown jewel for UK innovation, intellectual property, trade, and exports."

## Hydrogen Technology Characteristics

### Energy Density
- **Energy per Unit Mass:** Three times higher than kerosene
- **Volumetric Density:** Much lower than kerosene
- **Challenge:** Requires different aircraft design due to volumetric constraints

## Development Timeline

### Current Status (2024)
- Two UK manufacturers of hydrogen-powered aircraft: Airbus and ZeroAvia
- Some hydrogen-powered aircraft already flying
- HIA established (Summer 2023)

### Near-term (2024-2026)
- Additional CAA funding and capacity
- Liquid hydrogen supply for R&D and testing
- Reforms to hydrogen production funding (HAR)
- Aviation hydrogen demand estimates
- National Hydrogen Academy operational by 2025

### Medium-term (2027-2030)
- Two medium-scale liquid hydrogen Test Hubs
- Mature UK test capability network
- Commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft programme launched (Airbus)
- Regional zero-emissions aircraft (ZeroAvia)

### Long-term (2031-2050)
- **2035:** Airbus ZEROe aircraft entering commercial service
- **2035:** Commercial hydrogen-powered flights at pioneer airports
- **2030s:** ZeroAvia narrowbody aircraft with zero emissions
- **2050:** Net Zero aviation achieved

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Test Infrastructure
- **Test Hubs:** Two medium-scale liquid hydrogen Test Hubs needed
- **Network:** Mature UK test capability network

### Airport Infrastructure
- **Pioneer Airports:** Network of hydrogen pioneer airports
- **Timeline:** Infrastructure development by 2035
- **Planning:** Every airport should have 'hydrogen-ready' plan by 2024

## Regulatory & Policy

### Government Departments Involved
1. Department for Business and Trade (DBT)
2. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ)
3. Department for Transport (DfT)
4. His Majesty's Treasury (HMT)

### Regulators
- Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
- Health and Safety Executive (HSE)

### Timeline
- **2025:** CAA appropriately resourced for hydrogen regulations
- **2025:** Industrial strategy plan in place
- **2024:** Updated airport masterplan guidance

## Skills & Workforce

### Skills Development
- **National Hydrogen Academy:** Operational by 2025
- **Workforce Plans:** Industry to develop future workforce plans
- **Curriculum:** Work with academia to build curriculums
- **Skills Strategy:** Hydrogen Skills Alliance (HSA) developing specific strategy

### Talent Access
- Continued access to talent from abroad needed
- Growing skills need within and around aviation

## Investment & Funding

### Current Support
- Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) programme
- UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) - potential reinvestment
- Future Flight Challenge funding rounds

### Funding Needs
- Public investment in aerospace technologies beyond TRL6
- Reinvestment of ETS funds into aerospace technology
- Hydrogen transition fund for aviation (long-term)
- Flexible allocation rounds for hydrogen production funding

## Market Potential

### UK Leadership Opportunity
> "The UK has made significant contributions to the development of hydrogen-powered aviation technology... Now we need to do something that the UK has not always had a good track record for – turning our innovative and exciting R&D into a long-term productive industrial sector that can take advantage of these gains."

### Global Competition
> "The UK was at the forefront of the early technological advances in aviation, and we have the opportunity to achieve this again."

## Cost Targets

### Cost Competitiveness
- Target: Hydrogen as cost-effective if not cheaper than kerosene
- Policy support needed to improve price competitiveness
- Focus on short haul aviation initially

## Production & Supply

### Hydrogen Production
- Demand requirements of aviation sector should form part of national calculations
- Trade bodies to form '2035-2050' taskforce to assess production levels
- Government to clarify plans for hydrogen production beyond 2035, up to 2050

### Renewable Energy
- Maintain momentum towards increasing deployment of renewables
- Fairer cost allocation for low-carbon hydrogen producers
- Reduce electricity network costs for hydrogen production

## Key Quotes

### Johan Lundgren, CEO of easyJet and HIA Chair
> "Aviation brings huge economic and social benefits, and we need to make sure these are retained, and that flying does not revert to being something only the rich can afford."

### Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus
> "By the end of this decade, Airbus will have launched its commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft programme."

> "Success hinges on coming together with determination."
