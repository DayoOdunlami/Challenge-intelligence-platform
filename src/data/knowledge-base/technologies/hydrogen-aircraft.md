**Date:** March 2024  
**Organization:** Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA)  
**Last Updated:** 2024-03

## Overview

Hydrogen-powered flight offers significant potential to deliver Net Zero aviation. When produced using carbon-free energy, hydrogen flights will have no carbon emissions. Hydrogen also has the potential to deliver a cost-effective replacement for short haul aviation.

## Technology Status

### Current State

> "The use of hydrogen in aviation is already underway. There are already two manufacturers in the UK of hydrogen-powered aircraft, Airbus and ZeroAvia, and some of these aircraft are flying today."

### Key Manufacturers

1. **Airbus**
   - Committed to developing commercial scale hydrogen-powered aircraft
   - Target: Entering service in 2035
   - ZEROe aircraft programme

2. **ZeroAvia**
   - UK-based hydrogen-electric aircraft developer
   - Aircraft already flying today
   - Focus on regional and narrowbody aircraft

## Technical Characteristics

### Energy Density

> "While its energy-per-unit mass is three times higher than traditional kerosene-based jet fuel, its volumetric density is much lower."

**Key Quote from Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus:**
> "This leads to significant design challenges, but those whose solution is at reach with current technological capabilities."

### Propulsion Options

Hydrogen enables multiple options for aircraft propulsion:

1. **Direct Combustion**
   - Hydrogen burned in modified gas turbine engines
   - Similar to current jet engines but using hydrogen fuel

2. **Fuel-Cell Electricity**
   - Hydrogen converted to electricity via fuel cells
   - Powers electric motors for propulsion

3. **Combination (Hybrid)**
   - Combination of both direct combustion and fuel-cell electricity
   - Optimizes efficiency and power output

4. **Synthetic Fuels Feedstock**
   - Hydrogen as feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production
   - Enables low-carbon synthetic kerosene

## Development Timeline

### By End of This Decade (2030)
- Airbus will have launched its commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft programme
- ZeroAvia enabling regional aircraft with zero-emissions

### 2035
- Airbus ZEROe aircraft entering commercial service
- Commercial hydrogen-powered flights operational at pioneer airports

### 2030s
- ZeroAvia scaling technologies to support true zero flight in narrowbody aircraft
- Mainstream adoption of hydrogen-powered aircraft

## Development Challenges

### Design Challenges

1. **Volumetric Density**
   - Lower volumetric density than kerosene
   - Requires larger fuel tanks or different aircraft design
   - Solutions within current technological capabilities

2. **Storage**
   - Liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage
   - Infrastructure for liquid hydrogen at airports
   - Safety considerations

3. **Distribution**
   - Hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure
   - Pipeline or transport to airports
   - Refueling systems

### Infrastructure Requirements

> "For such an aircraft programme to be successful the maturity of its surrounding hydrogen ecosystem will be at least as important as the aircraft development."

Key infrastructure needs:
- Hydrogen production facilities
- Distribution infrastructure
- Airport refueling systems
- Regulatory environment

## UK Capabilities

### Leading Developers

The UK is home to leading developers of hydrogen-powered aviation technology:

1. **Rolls-Royce**
   - Engine technology development
   - Hydrogen combustion engine testing

2. **GKN Aerospace**
   - Aerospace components and systems
   - Hydrogen propulsion technologies

3. **Airbus**
   - Commercial aircraft development
   - ZEROe programme

4. **ZeroAvia**
   - Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems
   - Regional aircraft development

### UK Contributions

> "The UK has made significant contributions to the development of hydrogen-powered aviation technology, in particular through the Government's Aerospace Technology Institute programme."

## Regulatory Framework

### Certification Requirements

- CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) developing standards and procedures
- Coordination with EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency)
- Coordination with FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)
- Regulatory alignment on certification and operation

### Timeline

> "From 2025, the CAA should be appropriately resourced to address the challenges outlined in this report, working in co-ordination with other relevant bodies and the academic community to develop the required standards, procedures, and regulations."

## Cost Competitiveness

### Target

> "It also has the potential to deliver a cost-effective replacement for short haul aviation, as industry looks to ensure hydrogen is as cost-effective if not cheaper than kerosene."

### Policy Support Needed

> "The Government should develop policy support to improve the price competitiveness of hydrogen-powered aircraft versus kerosene-powered aircraft."

## Safety

> "Hydrogen has been safely used in the aerospace and automotive industry for decades"

Safety considerations:
- Established safety protocols from other industries
- Aviation-specific safety standards under development
- CAA regulatory oversight

## Market Potential

### UK Market

- UK aviation contributes ~7% of UK's total emissions
- Significant economic and social benefits of aviation
- Need to preserve these benefits while achieving Net Zero

### Global Leadership Opportunity

> "This is one of the rallying cries that brought Airbus, Bristol Airport, easyJet, GKN Aerospace, Ørsted, and Rolls-Royce together to form Hydrogen in Aviation (HIA) in September 2023... We are focussed on ensuring that hydrogen-powered flights become a normal everyday thing in the UK, and that the UK becomes a global leader in hydrogen-powered aviation."
