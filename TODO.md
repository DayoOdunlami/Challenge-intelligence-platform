## üé® Color Scheme Selector - Future Enhancement

**Status:** Work in Progress  
**Priority:** Low (Nice-to-have feature)

### Issue
The ColorSchemeSelector component currently only sets CSS custom properties but doesn't apply them to page elements. The UI shows theme options but visual changes don't take effect.

### Current Behavior
- ‚úÖ Dropdown works and shows theme options
- ‚úÖ Saves selection to localStorage
- ‚ùå Visual theme changes don't apply to page elements

### Solution Needed
Implement one of these approaches:
1. **CSS Classes Approach:** Use Tailwind's dynamic class switching
2. **CSS Custom Properties:** Properly wire up the CSS variables to component styles
3. **Context-based Theming:** Use React Context to manage theme state

### Files Involved
- `src/components/ui/ColorSchemeSelector.tsx` - Main component
- `src/styles/cpc-theme.css` - Theme definitions (partially implemented)

### CPC Brand Colors (Ready to Use)
```css
--primary-teal: #006E51;     /* Deep Teal - Brand identity */
--secondary-mint: #CCE2DC;   /* Mint Green - Backgrounds */
--tertiary-charcoal: #2E2D2B; /* Charcoal - Text, icons */
--background-light: #F9F9F9;  /* Off-White - Main background */
--info-blue: #4A90E2;        /* Slate Blue - Hyperlinks */
--warning-amber: #F5A623;    /* Amber - Notifications */
--success-green: #50C878;    /* Fresh Green - Success */
```

### Notes
- Feature is marked as "Coming soon" in the UI
- Amber indicator shows work-in-progress status
- Core platform functionality is complete and working
- This is a cosmetic enhancement for future development

## üêõ Chrome Particle Rendering Issue - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Status:** Bug Report  
**Priority:** Medium (Browser compatibility issue)

### Issue Description
Particle background system shows "glitchy edges" on right and bottom sides in Chrome browser when window size exceeds a certain threshold. Issue does NOT occur in Safari.

### Symptoms
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly in Safari at all window sizes
- ‚ùå Chrome shows particle rendering artifacts at larger viewport sizes
- ‚ùå Glitchy edges appear specifically on right and bottom boundaries
- ‚ùå Issue is window-size dependent (works fine at smaller sizes)

### Suspected Root Causes
1. **Canvas boundary calculations** - Particle grid may extend beyond actual canvas dimensions
2. **Chrome viewport handling** - Different from Safari's approach to large canvas sizing
3. **devicePixelRatio scaling** - Chrome may handle high-DPI differently at large sizes
4. **Particle grid initialization** - Grid size calculations may be off for large viewports

### Investigation Needed
- [ ] Test at various Chrome window sizes to find exact breakpoint
- [ ] Compare canvas.width/height vs getBoundingClientRect() at large sizes
- [ ] Check if particles are being created outside intended boundaries
- [ ] Verify particle grid calculations match actual canvas dimensions
- [ ] Test with Chrome DevTools device emulation at various sizes

### Files to Investigate
- `src/components/ui/CreativeHero.tsx` - Main particle system
- Canvas sizing logic in `setCanvasDimensions()`
- Particle grid initialization in `init()` function
- Boundary checking in particle update loops

### Notes
- Previous fixes addressed general Chrome performance but not this size-specific issue
- Need to understand exact window size threshold where issue begins
- May need Chrome-specific boundary clamping or canvas size limits
