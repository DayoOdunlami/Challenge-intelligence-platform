# Waterfall Chart Redesign

## What You Expected:
- **Total Funding** (£17.4B) 
- **Breakdown by Programme** (where money goes)
  - ATI Programme: £X
  - UKRI: £Y  
  - Advanced Fuels Fund: £Z
  - etc.
- **Scenarios adjust allocations** → show new breakdown

## What I Built (Wrong):
- Baseline → Adjustments → Projected (change analysis)
- Shows incremental changes, not breakdown

## What I'm Building Now:
- **Total Funding** → Breakdown by major programmes
- Scenarios recalculate programme allocations
- Shows "Where does the money go?" breakdown
