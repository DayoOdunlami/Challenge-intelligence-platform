# Integrating Perplexity Data

## Status

✅ **Format is perfect!** The data Perplexity provided is in the exact format needed.

⚠️ **But it's incomplete** - Only 2-3 examples per type with "// ... add more" comments.

## Integration Plan

I'll integrate the Perplexity data by:

1. **Merging** Perplexity's examples with existing data
2. **Completing** the missing entities based on their recommendations
3. **Creating** relationships between all entities
4. **Validating** all IDs and references

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

**Option A:** Integrate what Perplexity provided now, then we can request the complete dataset later?

**Option B:** Wait for Perplexity to provide the complete dataset (all 50+ entities)?

**Option C:** I complete the dataset myself using Perplexity's recommendations and format?

I recommend **Option A** - integrate what we have now, then we can expand later. This way we can:
- Test the data structure
- See how visualizations work with more data
- Identify any issues early
- Add more data incrementally

What would you prefer?
